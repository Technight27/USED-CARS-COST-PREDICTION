# Used Car Price Prediction

Developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices using linear regression. Performed data preprocessing, including handling missing values and one-hot encoding categorical variables. Utilized scikit-learn for splitting the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance. Achieved a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between car features and prices, visualized results with matplotlib, and demonstrated strong data manipulation skills with pandas. Evaluated model accuracy using mean squared error and R-squared metrics.
